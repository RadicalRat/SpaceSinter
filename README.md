# Purpose
This code stack was developed for the SolarSinter senior design team at the Colorado School of Mines. This project was the development of a road building system to concentrate solar energy to "melt" lunar regolith into glassy roads as a possible avenue for lunar infrastructure. This system utilizes a Kinova Jaco Gen2 arm for the deployment and manuvering of the fresnel lens. Software was created to connect this arm to ROS2 MoveIt! Pro, in order to have precise control of the arm and planned behaviors.
